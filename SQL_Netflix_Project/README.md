* Purpose:
A scalable analytics approach is used to handle over 80,000 records by leveraging PostgreSQL for fast, efficient querying and Power BI for mobile-friendly, interactive dashboards. Key insights—like genre trends, movie popularity, viewership habits, audience ratings, and top performers—are extracted using optimized SQL queries and subqueries. The results are presented as clear, visually engaging charts and graphs in Power BI, making it easy for Netflix stakeholders to explore data, share findings, and make informed decisions in a collaborative environment.
